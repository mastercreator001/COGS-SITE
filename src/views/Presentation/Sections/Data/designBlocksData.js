The establishment of a circularium was of key importance, as was the ethics the school would use as remember we are a faith-based school, so allowing for all aspects of education as well as the religious aspect was of key importance. The key for Mr Knight and his new staff was to be able to attract a collective reputation in a short amount of time to fill the school and start the mission. He had all the best tools as he had a new school, and it was cutting edge at the time, so the school's forms soon filled up. As a leader he was a strong character with a well-organized brain capable of handling classes should the need arrive. It was true of all the staff there were times all staff taught different subjects. Indeed, I remember Mr Harrison teaching English on one occasion, but Mr Knights specialty was math's as he was well up to the job. <br><br> Mr Harrison took the torch after Mr Knights retirement. <br><br>Mr Harrison who I had the good fortune to be taught by had such a gentle nature he was easily respected by staff and students. He had introduced the red letter, ah well,  if our new to the school or had spent any time at the school you would be familiar with them although now looking back I would have hoped to didn't' receive the infamous white letters? Did you? Mr Harrison was a great headteacher who was always happy to help listen to your issues or work towards a successful resolution. He was the man always in a smart suit and was well liked among the staff. I remember Mr Harrison helping out at one of our sports days and I personally had nothing but respect and pride when I came home with a red letter or merit badge helping me to succeed and believe in my ability to achieve and succeed. Mr Harrison was the second head teacher at the school and in my opinion he best but I can say all the head teachers have admired my respect based on the comments from the C of E Middle School Memory Corner group based on face book <br><br> Mr Bloomfield who saw the school into its twilight years. <br><br>Taking the school from the trinity status into the amalgamation phase into as we know now Christ The King. A series of dedicated teachers who excelled at being the very best for the staff and students. Mr Bloomfield was a mystery as I personally have little experience of his leadership but I do know to take after such a legend as Mr Harrison he was well placed to succeed as a successor.<br><br>And finally Mr Pat GoodHead is somewhat of an unknown as He has taken charge of the lower campus in the succeeding time after the school was amalgamated into Christ The King Campus. The former C of E Middle campus was utilized for a number of years after being transferred to Christ The King as the renovation and reconstruction of the main site was redeveloped (formerly The Arch Bishop King Site). When the building process was underway Mr Goodhead was in charge of both sites as head teacher. Mr GoodHead left Christ King School after the school had been demolished."

        text1: "The process and structure of a school is very important to its overall success and running and although I can only comment on my time at the school Mr Felton served as deputy head teacher for a substantial time during the school's existence. He was in place as the head teacher under Mr Knight's term and well into and I believe through Mr Harrissons as well. Mr Felton was always a strong personality and an authority figure in my time at the school. He like any other teacher had a dual teaching talent and although Mr Felton was a Deputy Head he was also found in the D.T or Design Technology department. Perhaps you remember the pencil Holder car you had the chance to make under his tuition or maybe the Parrot, it's a case if you know you just know I'm afraid. <br><br> Mr Felton was somewhat of a familiar face in the school and also on many school trips he was also an architect as well in the creation and organization of the trips. Imagine a large group of students and lots of activities to organize, although this was a yearly trip to Malham and Poole in Dorset trip for year 4's it still needing organization and staffing. <br><br> Mr Felton was on my trip to Malham, and it was as fun as you could imagine especially as it was one of the first trips away from home for allot of young people so seeing familiar faces were an absolute comfort. Mr Felton eventually retired after I left the school but served the school for decades and is now happily enjoying retirement on the Island with his wife."

During my time at the school, she was a form tutor also a Domestic science teacher a French teacher and I do believe she was also an English teacher as well. Aside from that she was also <a href='https://youtu.be/tMUhge07wZc' target='blank'>https://youtu.be/tMUhge07wZc</a> <br> <br>The Evacuees was I'm sure a stressful occasion for all staff involved and the logistics were I'm sure quite the challenge. Miss Forer Stayed in the school until the 2003 when she retired from the school, and I can happily say is enjoying her retirement."

Well to that end I'm going to start with Mrs Murdoch she was my 2nd year form teacher, and she was one of the best teachers I have ever had as she was kind gentle understanding patient and Scottish. I would never hold that against her as it was this very fact that made her so memorable. Whichever year you were in you knew Mrs Murdoch, we called her Super Gran, perhaps you remember her from the famous television show. 2M I will remember forever, and the kitchen exploits we're truly legendary. Perhaps you have heard of the cooking book she released as it's available in the County Press shop (Jams Tarts & Jalousie's) and there are some very Famous school Recipes like Beanie Pies or maybe something sweeter is to your fancy like marble cake. Mrs Murdoch was always a very pleasant teacher and with a head of white hair she always stood out from the crowd, although a Wee Lass she has a bursting personality.    <br><br> Mrs Hayles was a great teacher as I can personally relate to this as I was Also in 3H her form group. Mrs Hayles although quite quiet as I remember she was a genius in Math's. Her comes an admission, yes, I wasn't a math's genius, but she was as she hosted an advanced Math's set and hosted educated some real geniuses who are now out in the big wide world plying the Math's they were taught in C OF E Middle. <br><br> Mrs Hayles in my time had the end class looking into the void area near the science room and near the long Jump, do you remember it? The school was so small by today's standards and I'm sure to the people who visited in maturity perhaps at a reunion it did as well, but it was a fine adventure for which I'm happy to say Mrs Hayles will be fondly remembered by me. <br><br> Mrs Challoner, oh goodness please tell me I spelt it wright, it has been a long time. Here we have a long-standing teacher who I believe was at the school prior to my attendance and well after mine as well. Perhaps you have some funny stories or maybe she was your form teacher perhaps you can fill in the missing blanks here. Was Mrs Challoner a French teacher or perhaps math's ? My interactions with Mrs Challoner are exceptionally limited so I'd appreciate any help you guys or girls could offer, maybe point me in the right direction for some good stories. I do remember she was a teacher not to be crossed. I was not a perfect student full of mischief, but I do remember having been bellowed at for one thing or another. Sadly, I never had as far as I can remember any lessons at all, did you?  "

        text1: "Ah Caretakers were in my mind the coolest as they weren't here to punish us poor students or perhaps torment us in the classroom but they were usually understanding, kind and helpful. That's been my experience, what about yours? Perhaps they weren't always as helpful or kind. <br><br>For the opening of the school in 1971 we have Mr J.H.F Farrington who is listed as the schools caretaker and although I can't vouch for him as I wasn't there Im sure he was great, perhaps you were one of the first students and you can relate or have had some interactions with him? email us in the contact section and well get your stories added.<br><br> With my snippet of time at the school we Had Mr Houghton at the school and he was a grey headed man with fleeting glimpses of him litter picking while we were all confined to class. He is in the picture and if he seems familiar, he might just be as he served the school for a number of years. Indeed, as I remember the school had a very small turnover of staff as it was a well-liked and relaxed environment to work in. Yes, I'm sure there are stories which we will never be privy to but sometimes that's the best course. Mr Houghton was a well-liked member of staff, and he was responsible for our favorite time of the year, yes Christmas. Well, the decorations never erected themselves, did they? yes this was firmly the caretakers doing and I'm sure as I did you enjoyed the time for the decorations to come up and the school became a wonderous place decorated in a wonderful theme of the season. I'm sure it was alot of his work but as kids we never asked questions, we just enjoyed being kids and never thought how and who. <br><br>Mr Houghton was a keen photographer and was always taking snaps and gained quite the professional reputation as he was very accomplished aside from being a great caretaker, perhaps you have seen some of his photos?<br><br> I feel sure there were many other caretakers I may have missed and for my oversight I am truly sorry but my sense and information about the school and it's working are only created from my memory so perhaps you can end me some stories pictures or perhaps guidance on who was here and what I have missed. Any help would be truly appreciated, and we will build the picture together of C OF E Middle School welly road "
