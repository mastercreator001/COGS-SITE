    <View title="The school was disolved on 1 September 2008 when two middle schools on Wellington Road, Archbishop King Catholic Middle and Trinity Church of England Middle merged making the newly Formed Christ The King College. This was done in line with the education reforms that were being implemented to schools across the island at the time.The desire to expand beyond the then-current age range of 9â€“13 years was first registered in December 2004, shortly after a new headteacher, Pat Goodhead, was appointed. In 2006, after outstanding Ofsted inspections for Trinity, and the need for a new headteacher for Archbishop King, a joint governing body committee was formed and Pat Goodhead was appointed headteacher of both Trinity and Archbishop King. The amalgamation of the two schools moved on as there were positive responses from all involved, including clergy, parents and staff, which was confirmed during an official review. The schools were fully amalgamated in September 2008, resulting in the closure of Trinity and Archbishop King middle schools.
    
    The School as any would have been well planned for and as such plans were generated to facilitate a well built school within approvals from the local council and conforming to the general needs of it's intended future use. As you can see above with the map recreated from an original the basic layout of the school was decided years previously by a local arcitect in consultation with the Diosease Of Portsmouth and the local council.

All part of the design procees but the school was to be a natural wondrland as well as a school. Indeed it its later days it actually had a nature reserve and a pond to compliment all the extra trees and predetermined landscaping already decided upon in the planning phase. " >

    <View title="A rather local affair, although the school had influence from the Diosease of Portsmouth and indeed The Church Of England it was designed by local architects and the materials where pratical were also sourced locally. The builders then would naturally be local as well as was the case in this construction effort. Although the school was new it had the innovations to stand above the rest with a new modern design and all the sports and gym equiptment to match any of the leading schools.">

    <View title="Funding was a joint venture for the school with assets being relaised and matched between IWCC and the Diosease Of Portsmouth as the main fund contributers. There was also a round of funding to keep the school ahead of the rest as parents were also asked to add into the schools funds for general repair maintenance and upkeep anoung other things. Primarily by the time parents were asked to assist the school had been finished and was in general use.">
